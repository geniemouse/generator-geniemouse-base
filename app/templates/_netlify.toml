# NETLIFY BUILD & HOSTING SETTINGS
# ================================
# One-stop shop for all your Netlify hosting and build configuration do-das.
# Saves having to create _SETTINGS files (e.g. _redirects) within the project files.
#
# DOCUMENTATION -- https://www.netlify.com/docs/netlify-toml-reference/
##

[Settings]
# Added automatically by the Netlify CLI. It has no effect during normal
# Git-backed deploys.
ID = "YOUR_SITE_ID"

# Settings in the [build] context are global and are applied to all contexts
# unless otherwise overridden by more specific contexts.
[build]
    # Directory to change to before starting a build.
    # This is where we will look for package.json/.nvmrc/etc.
    base = "./"

    # Directory (relative to root of your repo) that contains the deploy-ready
    # HTML files and assets generated by the build. If a base directory has
    # been specified, include it in the publish directory path.
    publish = "./dist/"

    # Default build command.
    command = "echo 'default context'"


# Other useful Netlify settings include:
# [context.CONTEXT] -- Includes things like pulling through secret environment variables
# [[redirects]]
# [[headers]]
